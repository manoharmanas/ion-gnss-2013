  abstract = {On the road and during tactical maneuvers, the Blue Force must maintain
	situational awareness to effectively react and respond. The Tactical
	Network, or TacNet, is a mobile ad hoc communications network developed
	by Sandia National Laboratories to provide Blue Force personnel with
	secure access to critical data, such as real-time maps of resource
	positions. During development of the system, the Sandia team addressed
	a variety of issues, including the need for (a) mobile communications
	without fixed infrastructure and (b) security features, e.g., an
	access control list. The team considered commercial-off-the-shelf
	products, but determined that a semi-customized system would better
	suit its requirements. The final product, TacNet, a field-tested
	and proven mobile network, incorporates two major systems: (1) an
	In-Vehicle System, including a graphical user interface, and (2)
	a Dismounted Solution, also known as Tracker. TacNet employs a line-of-sight
	mesh radio network, which is self-forming, self-healing, and multi-hopping.
	Both the In- Vehicle and Tracker systems can be applied in combination
	or separately to a variety of purposes, including real-time training
	analysis, targeting capability, and friend or foe identification.
	This paper describes the development process for TacNet and its future
	potential, such as extending line-of-sight through unmanned aerial
	vehicles.},
